# week-5-jncr

- we created skeleton file structure together first - setting up express and evironment variables
- we created a kanban, without giving estimate timings
- at this point, we didn't discuss yet what our project would be
- we agreed to decide what our app would be at the point of needing to create our schema (but before creating them!)
